## Smolarkiewicz positive definite transport equation scheme

In this study we propose an independent implementation of MPDATA algorithm used in [EULAG model](http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/eulag/). Our method is designed with built-in grid decomposition for parallelism, also we develop CUDA kernels for calculating concentrations and pseudo-velocities on GPUs. The source code includes multiple simple physical test cases.
